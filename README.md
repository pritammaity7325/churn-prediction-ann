# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction Using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

## 📌 Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical problem for businesses, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.  
This project implements an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** model to predict whether a customer is likely to **stay with** or **leave** a company based on historical customer data.

The system is divided into three main components:

1. **Model Building & Training**
2. **Prediction Pipeline**
3. **Streamlit Web Application**

---

## 🧠 1. Model Building & Training

- The model is built using **TensorFlow (Keras)**.
- A **Churn Dataset** is used, containing both numerical and categorical features.
- Data preprocessing includes:
  - Handling categorical variables using **ColumnTransformer**
  - Feature scaling
- The trained ANN model is saved in **`.h5`** format.
- The preprocessing pipeline is serialized using **pickle** for reuse during prediction.

- `eda.ipynb` – Exploratory Data Analysis  
- `pred3.ipynb` – Model training and evaluation  
- `Saved_Model/churn_model.h5` – Trained ANN model  
- `Saved_Model/preprocessor.pkl` – Saved preprocessing pipeline

## 🔍 2. Prediction Module

- User input is collected in real time.
- Input data is transformed using the **same preprocessing pipeline** used during training.
- The ANN model outputs a **churn probability**:
  - **> 0.5** → Customer likely to churn  
  - **≤ 0.5** → Customer likely to stay  

This ensures consistency and reliability between training and inference.

## 🌐 3. Streamlit Web Application

An interactive web interface is developed using **Streamlit**, allowing users to:

- Enter customer details (credit score, age, geography, balance, etc.)
- View churn probability instantly
- Receive a clear **churn / not-churn** decision

The Streamlit application:
- Loads the trained ANN model  
- Loads the saved preprocessing pipeline  
- Accepts user inputs and displays results in real time  

### ▶️ To Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
